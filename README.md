# API Logs
A repository for code used to interact with APIs from various data sources. These are mainly code snippets from previous/ongoing work projects. Over time I expect to revisit these, and would like to improve my work in the process.

APIs used are listed below. Majority of these are written in python, with the exception of the [REDCap API](https://project-redcap.org/), which is something I saved from my time working with the [Ontario Birth Study](https://ontariobirthstudy.com/).
